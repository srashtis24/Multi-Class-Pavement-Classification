# Pavement Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying pavement surfaces (such as **dirt, cobblestones, asphalt, and other categories**) using deep learning models. The goal is to help in **transportation engineering and road surface analysis** by automatically detecting pavement types from images.  

---
## Project Overview
- Built a **multi-class image classification model** to recognize different pavement types.  
- Used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification.  
- Trained and tested the model on a dataset of pavement surface images.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
